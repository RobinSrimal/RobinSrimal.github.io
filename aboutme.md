title: Robin Srimal: Data Scientist

---
Welcome to my portfolio site.

While pursuing my PhD in philsophical anthropology I became increasingly interested in the topics of AI and Machine Learning. I started taking courses on Udemy to gain proficiency in Python and an insight into how machines "think" (or think?).

Finally I decided to go all in and join the Machine Learning and Data Science track at LambdaSchool - a 9 months fully remote coding bootcamp.

During this time I was lucky enough to collaborate with some outstanding developers and the fruits of these cooperations along with a few solo projects are displayed on this portfolio site.
