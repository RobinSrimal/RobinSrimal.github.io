title: Robin Srimal: Data Scientist

---

Welcome to my portfolio site.

My name is Robin Srimal and I am currently studying Data Science and Machine Learning at Lambda School. 

This website will contain the projects I worked on during my time at Lambda. Please check them out and 
feel free to contact me.

[Check out my blogpost about CO2-Emissions](https://medium.com/@robin.srimal/co2-emissions-west-to-east-d88c7a37eccd)

In it I look at CO2 emissions per country over the last 250 years. I am interested in the question which countries emitted the most amount of CO2 during history and which countries emit the most nowadays.
