This was my second collaboration with a crossfunctional team and the product of two intense months. 

MyDish is a recipe app written in React Native that enables users to create, modify and share their favorite recipes with other users. 

User research has shown low user retention - specifically because adding new recipes was somewhat tedious. Therefore the Data Science team focussed on features that made creating a new recipe as easy as possible.

In total we came up with three features. I engineered two of those and the API to host them using FastAPI. In addition I deployed the API to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

**Feature 1**

This feature retrieves the text from pictures of ingredients and instructions of a recipe. This is done through connecting to the Google Cloud Vision API. The text then is processed to fit the form of the app that is used to create a new recipe. 

**Feature 2**

This feature takes in the url of a recipe website, scrapes its context and processes the text to fit the form to create a new recipe

All that might sound a bit abstract so you can check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG_td_GyA7w&feature=youtu.be) to see the app in action.
