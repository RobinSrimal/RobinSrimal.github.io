My first crossfunctional project with frontend developers and fellow data scientists!

This is a product of an intense week and we are all very proud of it. The [website](https://songify.now.sh/) allows you to to search for your favorite song on Spotify and it will return the 6 most similar songs or - if you want to shock your musical taste buds - the least similar song. (The backend is hosted on Heroku, so it might take a few seconds to respond when accessed the first time.)

I trained a knn model for the most similar song search and implemented an algorithm using Numpy for the least similar song search.

The data was collected using Spotipy: an API provided by Spotify to access meta data of all their songs.
