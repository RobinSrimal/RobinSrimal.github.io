This was a great project and very satisfying to complete. 

**K-Means-Clustering** 

This algorithm was enhanced by using the ["Naive Sharding Centroid Initialization Method"](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/03/naive-sharding-centroid-initialization-method.html) and implemented solely with the use of Numpy

**DBSCAN**

The performance of the algorithm was improved using a K-D-Tree to compute distances between points. The rest of the code solely uses Numpy.
