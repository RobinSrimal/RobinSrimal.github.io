Recreating two famous machine learning algorithms only with Numpy was a very rewarding challenge.

**K-Means-Clustering** 

This algorithm was enhanced by using the ["Naive Sharding Centroid Initialization Method"](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/03/naive-sharding-centroid-initialization-method.html).

**DBSCAN**

The performance of the algorithm was improved using a K-D-Tree to compute distances between points. The rest of the code solely uses Numpy.
