title: Creating a Hotdog-Detector
bigimg: /img/hotdog.jpeg

This was one of my first projects in LambdaSchool, a tribute to one of my favorite shows: Silicon Valley and quite a lot of fun. 

The aim was simple: Train a convolutional neural net using Keras that can detect if a picture contains a hotdog or not. 

I used the COCO dataset to get the pictures but in hindsight a simple scrape would have been easier.
